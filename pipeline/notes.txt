How will this pipeline work?

Input: a cellpose trained model, images of cells to mask
Output: masks of images of cells

The problem is that Cellpose takes too long.
Therefore, we distill the Cellpose model into a smaller, faster model.
We use that faster model to create the cell masks.


Preliminary to pipeline:
A trained Cellpose model. Images of cells.

Pipeline:
1) Make Cellpose create masks for 5 images of cells.
2) Train a U-Net to segment these images of cells with Cellpose masks as gt.
3) Use that U-Net to segment all the other images and output them.

Extras:
- Have a GUI to do it all
- Have a checkbox to ask if there already are masks of cells that can be used
- What information do we use from Cellpose? Do we need the cell probabilities?
- Check the size of the images and if they are above 1024 then we have to pad them to a higher value
